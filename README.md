# Flavorful Finds - A Recipe Blog


## Project Overview

**Flavorful Finds** is a responsive, single-page recipe blog built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases dynamic content rendering, interactive search functionality, and a clean, modern design. The primary goal was to create a professional and elegant user experience for browsing and discovering recipes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Recipe Rendering**: Recipes are stored in a JavaScript array and are dynamically injected into the HTML, making it easy to add or modify content without changing the HTML structure.
- **Interactive Search**: A real-time search bar allows users to quickly filter recipes by title or description.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and looks great on devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Clean and Professional UI**: The design uses a balanced color palette, elegant typography, and subtle animations for a polished user experience.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are set to lazy-load, which improves performance by only loading images as they become visible on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the fundamental structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Flexbox for the header and CSS Grid for the recipe cards.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all dynamic functionality, including content rendering and search filtering.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a clean and logical directory structure:
